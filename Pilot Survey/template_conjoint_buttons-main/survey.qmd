# Template - Choice-based-conjoint Survey

::: {.callout-note}

There are two versions of the conjoint survey: "button" and "table". This is the "**button**" version.

In this version, the conjoint options are shown in buttons.

:::

This is a template of choice-based-conjoint survey. For this survey, we will ask you about your preferences for different types of apples.

::: {.sd_page id=consent}

# Consent

This survey is being conducted by students at The George Washing University. We will not be collecting any identifying data, such as your name or address. The whole survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Your participation is voluntary and you may stop the survey at any time.

If you would like to participate, please answer the following questions:

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'consent_age',
  label = "I am age 18 or older",
  option = c(
    'Yes' = 'yes',
    'No'  = 'no'
  )
)

sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'consent_understand',
  label = "I have read and understand the above information",
  option = c(
    'Yes' = 'yes',
    'No'  = 'no'
  )
)

sd_next()
```

::: {.sd_page id=screening}

# Screening Questions

For this example, I'm using the response here to screen out respondents - I'm only interested in people who choose **"Red"**, so if you choose "Blue" you'll be screened out.

Usually you would not tell respondents ahead of time how they will be screened - I'm just putting an explanation here since this whole survey is for demonstration purposes

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'screenout',
  label = "Before we go on, please select which color you prefer between these two:",
  option = c(
    'Blue' = 'blue',
    'Red'  = 'red'
  )
)

sd_next()

## Nice job!

We're almost done! We'd just like to ask just a few more questions about you which we will only use for analyzing our survey data.
