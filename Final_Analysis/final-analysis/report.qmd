# Abstract

# Introduction

Currently RFID devices are becoming ever more prevalent in common day use. As students, your ID card allows you to tap into buildings at will. For commuters, a simple tap and your fare is paid for. In this case study our team aimed to create an RFID device that met consumer needs by providing as vast array of attributes to choose from. A wildcard sub attribute of choice was also added which was the additional of implantable RFID devices.

These types of devices are small, non-toxic, pill shaped devices that can be self implanted into your hand and can act as a conventional RFID device as described above. This is commonly known as Bio-Hacking and an X-ray of this can be seen below in Figure 1 showing a pill like device implanted in the hand of an individual.

Further attributes for this survey are things such as price, compatibility, capacity, and range which will be discussed further in the survey design section of this survey.

# Survey Design

## Final Survey Layout

Our survey was split into three major components:

1.  **Survey Introduction**

    This portion of the survey filtered out respondents under the age of 18 and informed individuals if they weren't already knowledge about this field of devices using a hidden page that described what the devices are and how many people already use them in the real world.

2.  **Survey Questions**

    Here respondents were asked 6 questions pulled from our choice design. Each of which having three options which contained in of itself 5 major attributes: The Type of Device, Price, Compatibility, Tag capacity, and the range of the device. The levels of each attributes can be found in the table below:

3.  **Survey Demographics**

    After completing all survey content users are asked to complete certain questions about their demographics such as year and gender. Other things such as survey feedback we're also asked but are not crucial to analysis.

| Attribute Name |              Levels               | Unit             |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------:|------------------|
|  Device Type   | Card, Ring, Bracelet, Implantable | N/A              |
|     Price      |         \$25, \$50, \$75          | USD              |
| Compatibility  |        iOS, Android, Both         | Operating System |
|  Tag Capacity  |              1, 3, 5              | kilobytes        |
|  Device Range  |              1, 3, 5              | ft               |

: List of Final Survey Attributes

## Differences from the Pilot

Large differences came from the amount of weed out questions where now the survey only contains the age verification question. Another major difference is the lack of images within the survey but this has now been populated with images accurately depicting the available options. See Appendix 9 for an example of this.

# Data Analysis

In this section, the team will detail the analysis conducted on our final data.

## Sample Description

Our total number of respondents ended up being 226. To each of those 226 respondents, we asked 6 choice questions and received a total of 1,281 responses. The following table shows a breakdown of different demographic questions we asked on our survey.

```{r}
#| echo: false

stats <- data.frame(
    Average_Age = c(38),
    Percent_Men = c(49.11),
    Percent_Women = c(50.89),
    Percent_Afraid_of_Needles = c(23),
    Percent_Familiar_with_RFID = c(85.84)
)

kable(stats)
```

## Data Cleaning

Data was cleaned by first computing the time values for the survey. Next, we filtered out the bad responses, like respondents who did not complete all of their questions, or respondents who did not respond to all of the choice questions. Then we removed respondents who went through the survey too fast, put the data into "long" format, added values for the respondent and observer identifier, and put the ID variables up front. After this, we had 210 respondents remaining. 

## Modelling

Modelling is where our team began running into issues. One thing to look out for in logit models is whether or not respondents preferred a product if it cost more. Since this is generally not how consumers make decisions, if price has a positive beta coefficient, the entire population's data is suspect. After running the model, we found that our real data had a positive beta coefficient. Below is our real data's utility model:

$u_{j} = 0.0027x_{j}^{price} - 0.0315x_{j}^{capacity} + 0.2463x_{j}^{range} - 0.1234\delta_{j}^{typeRing} - 0.0281\delta_{j}^{typeImplant} - 0.0761\delta_{j}^{typeCard}$
$- 0.0214\delta_{j}^{compatabilityAndroid} +  0.0868\delta_{j}^{compatabilityiOS}$

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Code provided by Claude

model_coef <- tribble(
  ~Variable,                  ~Estimate,    ~`Std. Error`, ~`z-value`, ~`Pr(>|z|)`, ~Sig,
  "price",                    0.0026587,    0.0011029,     2.4106,     0.015925,    "*",
  "capacity",                -0.0315492,    0.0208764,    -1.5112,     0.130729,    "",
  "range",                    0.2463251,    0.0929895,     2.6490,     0.008074,    "**",
  "type_ring",               -0.1234112,    0.0974554,    -1.2663,     0.205393,    "",
  "type_implantable",        -0.0281179,    0.0968137,    -0.2904,     0.771485,    "",
  "type_card",               -0.0761160,    0.0946994,    -0.8038,     0.421533,    "",
  "compatability_android",   -0.0214399,    0.0829076,    -0.2586,     0.795944,    "",
  "compatabilityi_os",        0.0868401,    0.0848465,     1.0235,     0.306073,    ""
)

# Create the table
kable(
  model_coef,
  digits = c(0, 7, 7, 4, 6, 0),  # Different precision for each column
  align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r", "c"),
  caption = "Model Coefficients"
)
```

To combat this, we decided to simulate a model with reasonable priors and work from there. Below is the baseline model we used for this project:

$u_{j} = -0.5047x_{j}^{price} + 1.66915x_{j}^{capacity} + 1.0040x_{j}^{range} + 0.9881\delta_{j}^{typeRing} - 1.0987\delta_{j}^{typeBracelet} - 1.9183\delta_{j}^{typeImplant}$
$- 3.5868\delta_{j}^{compatabilityAndroid}-  1.3692\delta_{j}^{compatabilityBoth}$

# Results

In this section, our team will go over the results from our study.

## Willingness to Pay

Willingness to pay describes how important different features of product are by showing how willing a customer is to pay for a specific version of that feature. Below are four charts detailing how willing to pay our simulated customer base is for our four main attributes (not including price): the range of the RFID device, the capacity of the RFID device, the type of device, and what operating system the device can operate with.

![Willingness to Pay](images/plot_mnl_wtp.jpeg)

There are two types of attributes on the plots above: continuous and discrete. The continuous variables, on top, show a linear relationship with how much a customer is willing to pay and the increase in performance. In this case, performance is measured by the range at which the RFID device can operate and how much data it can store. The discrete variables, the type of device and operating system, tell a slightly different story. The "card" and "iOS" options for type and OS respectively are the baseline choices. Any type or OS above the baseline is preferred to it and vice versa. Here, we see that a ring RFID type with iOS compatibility would be the most heavily preferred combination.

Overall, our simulated customer base is much more willing to pay for device performance than type or operating system compatibility.

## Market Scenario

The below table shows our baseline for our market scenario.

    price = c(20, 16, 25, 15),
    range = c(1, 1, 1, 1),
    capacity = c(3, 1, 5, 1),
    type_ring = c(1, 0, 0, 0),

All RFID devices typically have a short range to prevent theft. Price justifications for most of the competitors was found on Amazon, links are below:

Our market share below illustrates that even with a high capacity and competitive price, RFIDinMe would only obtain market share of about 10%.

![Market Share](images/sim_mnl.jpeg)

We would argue that while there is potential for implant RFID devices to enter the market, expecting them to generate a large market share is optimistic. Cheap and pain free alternatives like rings are much easier to market and not nearly as scary. They are also
